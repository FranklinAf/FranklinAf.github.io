# Databases

The database project I selected is improving the database table for the contact project. I originally worked on this project within my DAD-220 course. This project was building a database that included contact information, images of specific locations, messages per each contact. I want to build an interface that interacts with this new SQL Server instance. MVC framework using Spring Web MVC and interaction with database built in artifact One.
	I selected this since databases interact with all web applications. I particularly had issues with different REST clients and sending information and getting inconsistent results. This was due to a proxy service I had running on my PC. After figuring that out, setting up controllers, model, and services to integrate with my database was much easier. As I had a method of testing. I was able to use REST architecture to do CRUD operations on the database I built in project one.
Please see the repository for all documentation I used to develop this project.
