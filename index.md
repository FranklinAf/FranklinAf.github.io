# Introduction

  I have been in the SNHU Computer Science program since February of 2018. I originally graduated in 2014 with an associates degree from NDSCS technical college in Computer Information Systems. But as I worked in the IT field as a system administrator. I found that I enjoyed working with software development. Which is why I went back to school to get my bachelors degree in Computer Science. Everything I have learned in this program I used immediately in my current position.

## Education
  What I have learned in this program isn't just how to Stack Overflow. Originally I had very little experience with how programs functioned. How they communicated with the local operating system and other systems. How they manage their memory within an operating system. It has made me a more valuable resource in my current company which has resulted in a new development position. I have successfully implemented a full software development lifecycle. Implemented automated unit testing, agile development methodology, and online repositories. Not only did I learn the technical side of the program. But it helped me communicate better with stakeholders when building new technology in my current position. As applications have moved toward web facing deployments this program has taught me how to navigate the ever changing world of software development. Using the knowledge from this program I have also integrated systems between database reporting and credit card REST APIs. Written stored procedures, enhanced SQL Server performance, built my own REST API with a frontend interface. These are only some of the examples of how I have used this knowledge in the short term before I even graduate.
  
## Project Work
  I have written projects that will be displayed here on my github. Some was work that I wrote during my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU. Enhancements to the original work. Others were brand new that I created within a week with the resources I have at home.
  I have created a code review in video form.
  The first project I worked on was rebuilding a previous database DDL structure only using the small amount of information I had about the old DDL structure. I moved from a MySQL database over to a SQL Server database.
  The second project I worked on was improving a C++ algorithm for searching through a large amount of data. This utilizes the Binary Search Tree data structure. 
  The third project I worked on was building a REST API for the first project database. It allows REST calls to interact with the first project that I build in SQL Server. All of these projects can be found in the section below.
