# Data Structures And Algorithms

The second project I worked on was the data structures and algorithms. It was originally created in my data structure course and it searched for a single record using vectors in C++ from a large csv dataset. 

I selected this project because utilizing data structures is important in the design of applications. Data structures allow programmers to make objects that are perfect for specific scenarios. And give flexibility through proven methods. I used in order sorting for a binary search tree in order to sort the data. Then allowed the user to search for more than one record at a time, similar values within the dataset.

It was improved by adding additional functionality. Allowing more than one record to be returned in a large search. While also utilizing binary search tree efficiency.
