# Software Engineering

  The software engineering project I selected is recreating a database design from a mySQL instance. I converted and rebuilt the entire database DDL in Sql Server on an instance I installed on prem. Now there is plenty more to do on this project. But I chose it because I find it important to know how to interact with both No SQL and SQL database types. As databases are used across all types of systems.
	While I was creating it, the challenges I faced was the limited documentation I had about the design of the database structure. The project was improved by adding new indexes to tables, and restructuring the foreign key constraints on the tables. Also by adding better storage of images into the database.

Please see the repository for all documentation I used to develop this project [Here](https://github.com/FranklinAf/FranklinAf.github.io/tree/main/SoftwareEngineering)<br>
